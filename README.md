# 🌱 Crop Recommendation System

## 📌 Overview
Ready to revolutionize agriculture with the power of machine learning? This project focuses on building a **Crop Recommendation System** that leverages data science to optimize crop selection for farmers. By analyzing environmental and soil factors, the system suggests the most suitable crops, enhancing productivity and sustainability.

## 🚀 Features
- Predicts the best crop to grow based on soil and climatic conditions.
- Uses machine learning algorithms to analyze data.
- Helps farmers make data-driven agricultural decisions.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Processing)
- **Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning Models)
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Data Visualization)

## 📂 Dataset
The system is trained on a dataset containing:
- **N, P, K** values (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium levels in soil)
- **Temperature** (°C)
- **Humidity** (%)
- **pH Level**
- **Rainfall** (mm)
- **Crop Label** (Target variable)

## 🔧 Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kavithmasamadinie/Crop-Recommendation-System.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd Crop-Recommendation-System
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## 📊 How It Works
1. The model is trained on historical crop yield data.
2. Features such as soil nutrients, temperature, and rainfall are analyzed.
3. A machine learning classifier predicts the best crop for given conditions.
4. The system outputs recommendations to aid farmers.

## 🔍 Results
- Achieved high accuracy in crop prediction using classification models.
- Visualized feature importance for better decision-making.

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- Integrate real-time weather API for dynamic recommendations.
- Deploy as a mobile/web application for farmers.
- Improve model accuracy with deep learning techniques.
